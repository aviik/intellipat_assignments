1. Write a while loop wher you take the integer input from command prompt,
  and if the number n is odd print "Number is odd" else print "Number is even".

2. Write a while loop wher you take the input from command prompt,
     The loop will contiue to print "you are great", till the pass integer is 8.
     On reciveing 8 , it should break the loop and print "out of loop".

3.  Write a big block stucture file, which when runs gives the foolowing output

   ########################
   ##   1. Write your Name      ##
   ##   2. Say Hello Name       ##
   ##   3. Exit the programme ##
  #######################
  What is you option : _ _

This programe should continuesly runs untill option 3 is not given.

4. Print the nth summation value for following series
   1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 +.......
   where x^y means y to the power of x. As input a value n is pass, so the summetion upto 
   that element has to be given.

5. Print the nth summation value for following series
   1^2 + ( 1^2 + 2^2 ) + (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2) + .......
   where x^y means y to the power of x. As input a value n is pass, so the summetion upto 
   that element has to be given. Hint : Try to use 2 loops.

6. Write down the function to print nth Fibonnaci value.
    0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13....
    Fibb(4) = 2

Hard:
7. Complete the Ex.6 but without using 3 variables for value exchange.

8.  Print the nth summation value for following series on Fibonacci series
   0^2 + ( 0^2 + 1^2 ) + (0^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) +(0^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 2^2)+ .......
   where x^y means y to the power of x. As input a value n is pass, so the summetion upto 
   that element has to be given. Hint : Try to use 2 loops. Combine Ex 5 & 6.
